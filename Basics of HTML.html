    <p>Tamil Nadu is a southern Indian state that has a remarkably rich cultural legacy.The people of Tamil Nadu are members of the famous Dravidian Family, which is regarded as one of the oldest civilizations in the world. Tamilians take great pleasure in their deeply ingrained culture and work very hard to preserve their 2000-year-old heritage, much like other South Indians do. The state has prospered since it was controlled by the Cholas, Pandyas, and Pallavas. They produced the architecture and art that are still in use and maintained today</p>
    <p>Tamil culture is deeply rooted and firmly fixed in the art forms and ways of life of Tamilians living all over the globe. To be precise, the illustrious Tamil culture is well exhibited through sculpture, traditions, philosophy, rituals, folk arts, literature, painting, establishments, festivities, architecture, language, religions, martial arts, sports, cuisine, dance forms, costumes, media, music, science, theatre, comedy, technology and so on.

    <h2>Language and Literature of Tamil Nadu</h2>

Dravidic language is nothing but a large family of languages spoken in south and central India and Sri Lanka, Nepal, Singapore and a few other Asian countries. Tamil language is regarded as one of the longest existing classical languages in the world. As a matter of fact, 2,200 years old Tamil-Brahmi letterings have been discovered at Samanamalai (Madurai district in Tamil Nadu).</p>

During the year 2004, the Government of India declared Tamil as a classical language, thus becoming the first legally distinguished Classical language of India.</p>
